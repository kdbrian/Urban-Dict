# Urban-Dict

# For this project let me state my goals clear
This is simple toy project, it is a text-based application where users do not engage in any way
Engagement is through posting of words not in the dictionary that can be ddeemed urban slang or not found in a normal dictionary, if 
found has an otherwise different meaning.

- Each project I do I want to be learning something in the course, to kick off since i have knoowledge of android
jetpack compose and foundations in firebase .

- Am going to use this projects to exploit the following concepts.
  - Animations in jetpack compose
  - How to make UI efficient by reducing recompositions
  - real time data display using firebase and jetpack
  - a realtime notification system using Firebase cloud messaging
  - Seamless navigation with optional auth
  - data caching efficiently
  - paging network resources.
  - among others that i might append later.

- Some of the libraries I will make use of include
  - Jetpack compose for the UI.
  - compose navigation
  - compose ; stateflow, sharedflow, and livedata 
  - firebase; realtime database, analytics, crashlytics
